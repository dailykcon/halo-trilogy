		<h3>The Beginning</h3>

		<br>
		
		<p style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">
				The year: 2552. The location: space. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Humanity faces the otherworldly threat known as the Covenant, an alliance of alien races that has slaughtered billions of humans over the course of nearly 30 years of the Human-Covenant War. The United Nations Space Command (UNSC) is the last line of defense, and through the SPARTAN-II program, humankind has a fighting chance against the Covenant, thanks to a collection of genetically enhanced super-soldiers that seem more machine than man at times.
				<br>
				<br>
				As <i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i> begins, the cruiser Pillar of Autumn has just fled a Covenant attack on the human colony planet of Reach. When the ship makes a slipspace jump as part of its escape maneuver, it stumbles upon a ringworld – the titular Halo. Thankfully, the ship just happens to have the legendary Spartan known as the Master Chief (otherwise known as John-117) on board. Under orders from Pillar of Autumn Captain Jacob Keyes, the Master Chief evacuates to the Halo, alongside his A.I. partner Cortana in tow (or, more properly, stuffed into a data chip and inserted into his armor). In their fight to survive, they discover that the Halo is a creation of the Forerunners, an ancient race of beings that were incredibly advanced in technology over a hundred thousand years earlier.
				<br>
				<br>
				Unfortunately, it turns out that the Covenant have unleashed a devastating menace in the course of their current combat – the Flood, a collection of relentless, parasitic organisms that has only one goal: Feed on any sentient life and infect them. The Master Chief encounters 343 Guilty Spark, the A.I. monitor of this Halo installation who tells the Master Chief that he must activate the Halo to annihilate the Flood.
				<br>
				<br>
				Cortana points out that this will destroy humanity (and every other form of life in the galaxy) as well, so the Master Chief sets out to destroy Halo before it unleashes its fury – using the Pillar of Autumn to self-destruct seems like the best course of action. The Master Chief tracks down Captain Keyes to obtain authorization, but he’s already been infected by the Flood. In death, however, Keyes provides the path to victory for all humankind.
				<br>
				<br>
		</p>
		<br>
				
		<h3>Combat Evolves Again</h3>
		<br>

		<p style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">
				As <i>Halo 2</i> begins, the Master Chief is commended for a job well done, alongside Sgt. Avery Johnson. But that glory is short-lived, as the Covenant soon unleashes an attack on Earth, eventually penetrating the planet’s defenses and landing in New Mombasa, Kenya. The Master Chief repels this attack and pursues the Covenant’s High Prophet of Regret alongside Sgt. Johnson and Commander Miranda Keyes, daughter of Jacob Keyes, eventually arriving at yet another ringworld: Delta Halo.
				<br>
				<br>
				<i>Halo 2</i> also introduced players to the inner workings of the Covenant for the first time. Thel ‘Vadam, the Covenant Elite who failed to protect the Halo ring the first game, is branded a traitor and heretic, but given a chance at redemption as the Arbiter. Of course, this also means a death sentence, considering the unconscionably dangerous nature of his missions, but he’ll ultimately be revered among the Covenant as a martyr.
				<br>
				<br>
				Battling across Delta Halo, the Master Chief disposes of the High Prophet of Regret, while the Arbiter finds himself betrayed by Tartarus, leader of the Covenant Brutes. The Master Chief and the Arbiter ultimately meet in the tentacles of the Gravemind – the seemingly omniscient Flood intelligence – who explains that the Covenant’s so-called “Great Journey” that would come with the activation of all Halo installations is nothing more than suicide. To that end, the Gravemind demands that they stop the Covenant from firing Delta Halo.
				<br>
				<br>
				The Master Chief is transported to the Covenant capital of High Charity and pursues the High Prophet of Truth, while the Arbiter winds up on Delta Halo, where he must confront the Covenant Brutes who have betrayed him and his kind. From there, everything goes haywire: The Flood crashes the UNSC ship In Amber Clad into High Charity, while the Arbiter confronts Tartarus on Delta Halo. Meanwhile, Miranda Keyes manages to initiate a fail-safe on this Halo – meaning that every Halo location across the galaxy can now only be activated from a mysterious location known as the Ark.
				<br>
				<br>
				After dealing with all that, there’s only one thing on the Master Chief’s mind: He’s going to finish this fight.
				<br>
				<br>
		</p>
		<br>

		<h3>Finishing the Fight</h3>
		<br>

		<p style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">
				When we first see the Master Chief in <i>Halo 3</i>, however, he’s made landfall back in East Africa, after a terrific fall from outer space. When he comes to, he’s surrounded by Sgt. Johnson and the Arbiter, who alongside Miranda Keyes and the rest of the UNSC, are plotting to take down the High Prophet of Truth. Before they have time to execute an effective attack, however, the Prophet of Truth opens up a portal to the Ark; the Master Chief and his crew have no choice but to follow.
				<br>
				<br>
				Everything comes to a head at the Ark, complete with an unprecedented amount of backstabbing and double-crosses. The Prophet of Truth kidnaps Johnson, since only a human can actually activate the Halo installations. Keyes dies attempting to sacrifice herself and Johnson and prevent a galaxy-wide catastrophe, but the Prophet of Truth forces Johnson to initiate the activation of all the Halo installations across the galaxy.
				<br>
				<br>
				Meanwhile, the Flood makes an appearance, but now as an apparent ally of the Master Chief and the Arbiter. The Gravemind tells the duo that only they can stop the Prophet of Truth together; the Master Chief deactivates the Halo installations, while the Arbiter unleashes his own brand of stabby justice on the Prophet.
				<br>
				<br>
				With that, sanity finally seems to reign, but the Gravemind unveils a double-cross of his own, hoping to spread the flood across the galaxy and eventually forcing the Master Chief to activate a replacement ring of the Halo destroyed in the first game, in order to finally defeat the Flood. Turns out, 343 Guilty Spark doesn’t like this idea, however… and he goes crazy and kills Sgt. Johnson. The Master Chief blasts away Guilty Spark and activates the Halo, but as he and the Arbiter make their escape in the UNSC frigate Forward Unto Dawn, only the front half makes it through the portal – the half with the Arbiter. The Master Chief and Cortana are trapped in deep space, and will presumably be floating there for quite a while without any way to call home.
				<br>
				<br>
				After his heroic deed out in space, the Master Chief is ready for well-deserved cryo-sleep, however, and he leaves Cortana with a message: “Wake me when you need me.”
